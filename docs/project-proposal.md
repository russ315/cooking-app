# Cooking App - Project Proposal

## Project Overview

The Cooking App is a smart recipe recommendation system designed to help users discover recipes based on ingredients they have available in their fridge or pantry. The application aims to reduce food waste and inspire culinary creativity by matching available ingredients with suitable recipes.

## Problem Statement

Many people struggle with:
- Not knowing what to cook with available ingredients
- Food waste due to unused ingredients
- Lack of inspiration for meal planning
- Difficulty finding recipes that match dietary restrictions

## Solution

Our application provides:
- **Inventory Management**: Users can track ingredients in their fridge/pantry
- **Smart Recipe Matching**: Algorithm-based recipe recommendations based on available ingredients
- **User Authentication**: Secure user accounts to personalize the experience
- **Recipe Search**: Advanced search capabilities with filtering options

## Objectives

1. Develop a robust backend API using Go
2. Implement secure user authentication with JWT
3. Create an efficient recipe matching algorithm
4. Build a scalable database schema
5. Provide comprehensive API documentation

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Go (Golang)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger
- **Version Control**: Git with feature branch workflow


## Success Criteria

- Application compiles and runs successfully
- All modules are properly integrated
- API endpoints are documented
- Code follows Go best practices
- Project structure demonstrates clear separation of concerns

## Timeline

See `docs/gantt-chart.md` for detailed project timeline and milestones.
